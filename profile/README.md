Welcome to the Nexus homepage. Nexus is primarily developed and maintained by the Shanghai AI Laboratory. We also welcome contributions to our project in various forms.


## ðŸš€ Release

ðŸŽ‰ Nexus 1.0

- [03/2025] We are excited to propose Project Nexus, the worldâ€™s first open-source AIGC platform for embodied intelligence.  It offers low-cost, high-fidelity, interactive data, significantly reducing the cost and improving the success rate of embodied AI training. Corresponding scene, object, and motion generation models are publicly available.

## âœ¨ Models

### Object Models
- [Infinite-Mobility](https://github.com/Intern-Nexus/Infinite-Mobility): Scaling High-fidelity Articulated Object Synthesize using Procedural Generation.
- [MVMat](https://github.com/Intern-Nexus/MVMat): Multi-view PBR Material Diffusion Model for Untextured Meshes.

### Scene Models
- [Horizon-GS](https://github.com/Intern-Nexus/HorizonGS): Unified 3D Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale Aerial-to-Ground Scenes.

### Motion Generation Models
- [ScaMo](https://github.com/Intern-Nexus/ScaMo): A scalable motion generation framework.

## ðŸ§± Community Contributions
